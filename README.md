# ab-test
This repository contains notes, models, and findings related to AB tests and causal inference.

- Foundational concepts for A/B tests: central limit theorem, variance of sample mean, variance of the difference of two independent quantities
- Simulation of experimental data (expan, teatasting packages)
- Variance estimation methods: analytical, empirical, bootstrap, delta method
- Variance reduction techniques
- Sanity checks (sample ratio mismatch)
- Power analysis
- Multiple testing frameworks
- Observational causal inference methods: synthetic control, difference-in-differences, double machine learning etc.
